# Conclusions and Results

In this workshop, you learned how to leverage the Trend Micro Zero Trust Platform to help you connecting your virtual/remote workforce to individual corporate resources, and also to the internet, while it implements continuous risk assessment by analyzing threat factors of assets. The access to specific resources can be changed dynamically based on increases or decreases in risk, and that is what we saw happening in this workshop. Trend Micro Vision One™ Risk Insights gathers telemetry and data to automate decisions by leveraging the Trend Micro endpoint agent and network tools. In this way, the security risks can be mitigated as soon as they are detected.
