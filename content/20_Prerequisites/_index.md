#### Identity Access Management (Microsoft Azure AD)
Integrate a supported IAM system with Zero Trust Secure Access and grant the required permissions.

> In this lab, we are considering that you have an Microsoft Azure AD Account.

Zero Trust Secure Access supports the following IAM systems:

* [Azure AD - How to Setup](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/trend-micro-vision-one/zero-trust-secure-ac/gettingstartedchapte/deploymentguides/privateaccesssetupov/iamintegrationovervi/azureadiamsetup.aspx)
* Okta
* Active Directory (on-premises)

You must grant certain permissions within your IAM system to enable Zero Trust Secure Access to monitor user sign-in attempts, access user data, and perform actions on user accounts. To enable user authentication for Private Access and Internet Access, you must configure SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) for your IAM system.

Go to [this url](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/trend-micro-vision-one/zero-trust-secure-ac/access-configuration/ztsa-identity-and-ac/iam-system-settings.aspx) to find the required permissions to enable this feature.
