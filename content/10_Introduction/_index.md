## TREND MICRO™ ZERO TRUST SECURE ACCESS
As the recent transition to a remote or hybrid workforce has widened the digital attack surface, increasing cyber risk significantly across many organizations, the old adage of “trust, but verify” is no longer practical. The growing interest and movement toward Zero Trust architectures in the past few years has shifted this approach to the more accurate, “never trust, always verify”.

And for good reason. The broad implicit-trust methods and practices haven’t kept pace with stealthy, more resourceful threat actors. Organizations need to modernize the
methods used to securely connect users, devices, and applications no matter where they are or what they need to access.

### REVISING TRUST IN YOUR ORGANIZATION

In most organizations, implicit trust is the standard. This opens the organization to considerable risk, where a single compromised identity can begin to wreak havoc in the environment and largely move throughout the network unabated.

Much like digital transformation, the path toward Zero Trust is a journey, not a solution. There are a number of ‘initial steps’ that can be taken depending on the highest priority
risk in your organization and your current security posture. While more use cases exist, which over time can be implemented as your organization moves towards Zero Trust architecture, the initial steps include:

1. Securing access to the internet
2. Delivering fast and secure access to cloud applications
3. Transforming your remote access solution

### What is a Zero Trust Architecture?

##### The ZT architecture approach assumes that no connection, user, or asset is trustworthy until verified. Conversely, the traditional perimeter security paradigm trusts connections once authenticated and grants them access to the entire network, leaving enterprise assets potentially open to cybercriminals. Transformative and time intensive, ZT projects build upon and rework existing architecture.

<b>Zero trust architecture</b>
ZT architecture is an evolving concept that at present has no certifications or practical standards. Many enterprises rely on certifications such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) compliance, and the absence of well-defined parameters in the case of ZT creates a measure of confusion.

Adding to the confusion, some vendors label a product or a service as a complete ZT solution, ignoring the basic premise that ZT is an approach that utilizes existing and new products and services but does not reside in a particular set of products or services. Worse, many will apply this practice of “zero trust washing” to legacy products despite missing core properties.

<b>Zero trust frameworks</b>
Various ZT frameworks and approaches are available. ZT is a concept, but the basics of a ZT framework have been defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and by analyst firms such as Gartner, Forrester, IDC, and ESG.

* In its special publication Zero Trust Architecture, NIST discusses how the U.S. government is employing ZT strategies. The 50-page document defines the basics of an ideal ZT implementation and offers federal government deployment scenarios and use cases. While Gartner, Forrester, IDC, ESG, and other analyst firms are in agreement with NIST on the term “zero trust” and many definitions, approaches, and frameworks, these firms differ in terminology for many of the same concepts

* For example, Gartner uses the term Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) to describe the combination of Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), secure web gateway (SWG), and advanced virtual private network (VPN) while Forrester calls it Zero Trust Edge (ZTE).

Analyst firms are beginning to offer roadmaps along with valuable guidance, and organizations can find excellent information from those sources to start their ZT journey.


<b>Zero trust basic principles</b>
ZT starts with a set of principles that each enterprise implements according to its business and security needs.

* Consider all data and services as resources – many different classes of devices and services make up today’s networks. Services such as SaaS, cloud services, and personal devices that access enterprise resources are candidates for inclusion under the ZT umbrella.
* Do not trust network location or identity – traditional perimeter-only security operates with a single door for users to gain access to enterprise resources. Once authenticated, a user gains broad access to enterprise-owned assets. This practice opens the door for malicious actors as well. Once they gain access, they can move laterally throughout the network, installing malware and ransomware as they go.
* Grant access to a resource for only one session – establish trust before granting access and give the lowest level of privileges to get the task done.
* Determine access based on a dynamic policy – policy is a set of access rules assigned to a subject, asset, or application. Establish policy based on the needs of your business and the amount of risk you can accept. A dynamic policy may include continuously monitored risk levels of users, devices, and behavioral attributes such as observed usage patterns. It may also include environmental attributes such as network location, time, and active attacks.
* Presume no asset is inherently trustworthy – evaluate the security posture of the asset during a resource request using a continuous monitoring system. Include personal devices as well, selecting the level of access these devices will have. This is not as radical as it seems, because of how quickly proven secure servers can be exploited through vulnerability disclosures or a change in a small component, such as an open-source library inclusion.
* Verify trust continuously – trust is not a fixed state. If user or device risk increases, take action immediately by terminating connections or resetting accounts.
* Strictly enforce authentication and authorization – use dynamic principles to constantly scan, assess threats, adapt, and reevaluate trust during communications. Establish an identity, credential, and access management system (ICAM), including multifactor authentication (MFA) for applicable resources. Base policy reevaluation on time, unexpected activity, or a request for a new resource, for example.
* Collect as much information as possible – information about asset security posture, network traffic, and requests for access are extremely valuable. Use them to gain insight to improve security policies and enforcement.
