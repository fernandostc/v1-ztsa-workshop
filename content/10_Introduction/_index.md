## TREND MICRO™ ZERO TRUST SECURE ACCESS

As the recent transition to a remote or hybrid workforce has widened the digital attack surface, increasing cyber risk significantly across many organizations, the old adage of “trust, but verify” is no longer practical. The growing interest and movement toward Zero Trust architectures in the past few years has shifted this approach to the more accurate, “never trust, always verify”.

And for good reason. The broad implicit-trust methods and practices haven’t kept pace with stealthy, more resourceful threat actors. Organizations need to modernize the
methods used to securely connect users, devices, and applications no matter where they are or what they need to access.

### REVISING TRUST IN YOUR ORGANIZATION

In most organizations, implicit trust is the standard. This opens the organization to considerable risk, where a single compromised identity can begin to wreak havoc in the environment and largely move throughout the network unabated.

Much like digital transformation, the path toward Zero Trust is a journey, not a solution. There are a number of ‘initial steps’ that can be taken depending on the highest priority
risk in your organization and your current security posture. While more use cases exist, which over time can be implemented as your organization moves towards Zero Trust architecture, the initial steps include:

1. Securing access to the internet
2. Delivering fast and secure access to cloud applications
3. Transforming your remote access solution

### INTRODUCING TREND MICRO ZERO TRUST SECURE ACCESS

As part of Trend Micro Vision One™, Trend Micro Zero Trust Secure Access follows the principles of Zero Trust networking. This strengthens your overall security posture by enforcing strong access control permissions from multiple identity services across the organization.

Instead of granting access to the entire network, as a VPN does, Zero Trust Secure Access provides a gateway to specific applications and resources, restricting access to everything within the network that is not being employed. If valid user credentials are stolen, the level of access they will grant to the organization can be contained, effectively reducing the blast area of any attack.

#### SECURES ACCESS TO THE INTERNET

- <b>Provides agent and agentless protection for secure web browsing and unsanctioned app access.</b>

- <b>Presents highly contextualized data to Trend Micro Vision One for greater visibility.</b>

- <b>Offers visibility into internet access and browsing to return security and policy control.</b>

- <b>Protects both corporate and bring-your-own (BYO) devices.</b>
 
- <b>A native part of Trend Micro Vision One.</b>

- <b>Powered by Trend Micro™ Web Reputation Service, Trend Micro Research, and Trend Micro Vision One™ Risk Insights.</b>

#### SECURES ACCESS TO THE PRIVATE APPLICATIONS

- <b>Provides agent and agentless access with detailed control options, for easy end-user access to corporate apps and resources.</b>

- <b>Reduces the implicit trust of VPNs for greater risk assessment.</b>

- <b>Delivers authenticated and secure just-in-time access to apps and resources for greater protection.</b>

- <b>Reduces the blast area if there is a threat by limiting access to only specific parts of the network.</b>
 
- <b>Provides continuous risk assessment powered by Trend Micro Vision One Risk Insights.</b>

- <b>Controls connections to apps and resources with continuous risk assessment – dynamically allowing and revoking access as risk profiles change.</b>

#### CONTINUOUS RISK ASSESSMENT

As we continue to measure cyber security risk more closely to business risks, we can see that it is not a ‘one and done’ concept.

Indeed, risk is always changing and must be continuously assessed to be useful as a mechanism to improve security posture. Trend Micro Vision One Risk Insights provides that function of continuous risk assessment for Zero Trust Secure Access.

At regular intervals and dynamically in real-time, risk rating data from Risk Insights is used to evaluate current connections between users, devices, and applications. If at any point the risk rating exceeds customizable thresholds, the connection is blocked, and the network is protected against exposure. When the risk returns to within tolerance, the connection can be reestablished, and operations can continue securely.

### RISK INSIGHTS
#### Expose and prioritize risks for better decision making
As part of Trend Micro Vision One™, Trend Micro Zero Trust Secure Access follows the principles of Zero Trust networking. This strengthens your overall security posture by enforcing strong access control permissions from multiple identity services across the organization.

Threat actors have become more stealthy and sophisticated, utilizing complex techniques to compromise devices and spoof identities.
This allows criminals to spread attacks laterally throughout an organization’s network to steal sensitive data and often demand a ransom for its retrieval.

##### Security is job zero
This changing threat landscape means that beginning your cyber health journey no longer begins and ends by simply installing a cybersecurity product. IT teams need to adopt a Zero Trust strategy. While there is an “inherent trust” organizations instill on their architecture, Zero Trust prohibits attackers from piggybacking on that institutionalized trust.

##### Employing a Zero Trust strategy
This approach helps IT teams thwart attackers by limiting access to resources and only allowing access via trusted, verified devices. Employing a Zero Trust strategy requires continuous and in-depth monitoring of devices and a sufficient level of identity health.

##### Addressing the needs of Zero Trust
As most modern access control solutions perform only cursory posture checks and only perform this duty during the initial connection, decision makers require greater visibility and insight into risks in order to transform a “trust strategy” into a Zero Trust strategy.

#### INTRODUCING TREND MICRO RISK INSIGHTS
Risk Insights equips security teams with the ability to continually monitor the security posture of their organization, exposing unseen risks to make better decisions. Across the organization, Risk Insights assists:

- <b> SOC/Security teams –
Uncover undiscovered risks and gain insight into what needs immediate attention. View risks by user, device, and application, or at the organization level.

- <b> CSO/Leadership –
Understand the organization’s security posture, whether it is improving or declining, and gain visibility into how it compares to peers in your industry, region, or organization size.

- <b> Network security –
Incorporate health scores into access control solutions and make more informed automated decisions when following a Zero Trust strategy.

#### ADVANTAGES
#### Increase visibility into threat and posture risks

- <b> Provides continuous risk analysis of devices, identities, content, and applications. This includes active risks such as:</b>

    -- Suspicious or anomalous user activity

    -- Indicators of attack (IoA), behaviors, or detections

    -- Potential risks such as vulnerabilities, exposed identities, or risky cloud app access
- <b> Allows for deeper insight into your organization’s health level—pulled from endpoint, email, mobile, network XDR telemetry, and other data sources—to uncover hidden risks</b>
- <b> Leverages intel from leading Trend Micro vulnerability research experts to detect unpatched operating system and application vulnerabilities within your environment</b>
- <b> Instills a Zero Trust strategy throughout your organization by providing your security team with continuous health assessments of your identities and devices</b>

---
### Prioritization and automation for better risk-based decisions
- <b> Highlights the most critical risks affecting your organization so your team can maintain a trusted security environment</b>
- <b> Uses global and local exploit intelligence to prioritize patching of device vulnerabilities. Identifies if prevention rules are available to protect against exploits until Patch deployment.</b>
- <b> Mitigates and contains risks across the infrastructure from just one console.</b>
- <b> Shares health scores with Trend Micro and third-party access control solutions—including Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) to make automated and well-informed decisions.</b>
