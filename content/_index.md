## Trend Micro Zero Trust Secure Access
### Redefine trust and secure digital transformation with continuous risk assessments 
![TrendMicro](/images/logo.png)

With this guide, you’ll learn how to demonstrate the Trend Micro Zero Trust Platform, showing how remote users can remotely connect with remote applications and the internet while using a different approach that implements continuous risk assessment by analyzing threat factors of assets. Access to specific resources can be changed dynamically based on increases or decreases in risk. Trend Micro Vision One™ Risk Insights gathers telemetry and data to automate decisions by leveraging the Trend Micro endpoint agent and network tools.

## Use Cases Covered in this Demo
With this Demo, you can simulate Real-World use cases like:

  <b>- Use Case A - Private Applications Hosted in AWS</b>

  - A company is hosting private applications on its AWS Account and wants to let its remote workforce access these applications remotely.
  - They also want to make sure that the current risk level of each user or device is considered before letting these remote users or devices access the private applications.
  - If the user's risk level is above a specific threshold, the solution should respond automatically, adjusting the access level based on the policies created by the administrator.

  <b>- Use Case B - Internet Access Control (Remote Workforce)</b>

  - Due to Covid-19, a company had to move 2000 employees to WFH.
  - When the users are working from the office, they count on NGFW, NGIPS, Web Proxy, and other tools to help protect the company, its data, and its users. After the WFH adoption, the AV Solution reports showed a 200% increase in detections. The company is worried about the risks related to zero-day attacks and their impact on the company.
  - The InfoSec Team wants to deploy the ZTSA Internet Access Control to enforce security, preventing the users from accessing malicious/unappropriated content and, at the same time, allowing the company to restrict access to specific contents (like Collaboration/O365) in case the risk level of the remote users/computers is above a specific threshold.
