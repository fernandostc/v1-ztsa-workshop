## Use Cases Covered in this Workshop
With this workshop, you can simulate Real World uses cases like:

> <b>1- </b>A company is hosting private applications on their CSP (AWS/Azure/GCP) and what to let their remote workforce to access these applications remotely. They also want to make sure that the current risk level of each user or device is considered before letting these remote users or devices access the private applications. If any malicious os suspicious activity is detected, the solution should respond automatically adjusting the access level based on the policies created by the administrator.

> <b>2- </b>A company is worried about their remote workforce, that works from home and are being the target of different kind of attacks. They want to deploy a solution to help them enforcing the internet access control, blocking the access to malicious urls, download of malicious files, or just controlling the access to legitimate/trusted applications. In case some malicious activity is detected on the remote endpoints, the solutions should automatically adopt the access level restricting how the users are interacting with the Internet and Internal Applications.
